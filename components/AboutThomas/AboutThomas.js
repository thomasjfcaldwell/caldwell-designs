			<AboutThomasText>
				A keen traveller, surfer and runner British by birth, but based in the
				US. Always curious about code and how web sites work but equally scared.
				An opportunity arose at a passed employment to set up and then
				management of a E-commerce site. With a thirst for knowledge I enrolled
				in Web Development Bootcamp to start my journey in front end
				development. Since completing my Bootcamp I have gained experience
				designing and developing websites for local businessâ€™ and my own
				e-commence site. Still thirsty I am looking for a role that will quench
				my thirst by demanding that am always pushing myself to improve every
				day.{' '}
